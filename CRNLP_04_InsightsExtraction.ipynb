    "As you can see, the algorithm struggles with accurately labeling proper names. This issue can often be addressed by supplementing the training data. For instance, adding the label `('eustaquio', 'np00000')` could help the algorithm correctly identify 'Eustaquio' as a proper noun. Usually, a single additional label like this would suffice to correctly tag other proper names. However, because our algorithm was initially trained on a relatively small dataset containing just 6030 sentences, one small change can have unintended side effects. For example, after retraining with this new label, you might find that common nouns like 'ostrich' start being incorrectly identified as proper names, primarily because they were not in the original training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this juncture, it might be tempting to correct these errors, but it's essential to remember our broader learning objectives. We are still in the initial stages of understanding the underpinnings of this field. In a real-world application, these algorithms are trained on much larger datasets, and any mislabeling is manually corrected. The benefit of using more extensive training data is that individual corrections are less likely to disrupt other components that are already functioning correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's proceed without retraining using the `cess_esp.tagged_sents()` dataset, and continue working with the 'sn.e-SUJ' label for proper names (which is the label trained in our dataset). While this is not an ideal approach, it prevents our algorithm from becoming confused when we make corrections to the tags.\n",
